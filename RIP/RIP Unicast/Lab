Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
You are the junior network engineer of a company selling Videogames. The company has a small network running RIP between their routers. It seems something is going wrong with RIP multicast traffic. Think you can solve this game?
Goal:
All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
Both routers have a loopback interface as following:
Game: 1.1.1.1/24
Over: 2.2.2.2/24
Configure RIP version 2 on both routers, achieve full connectivity for all networks (including the loopbacks).
You are not allowed to send RIP packets by multicast or broadcast.
