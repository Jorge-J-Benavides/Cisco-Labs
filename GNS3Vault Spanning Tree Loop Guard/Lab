Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.
The network agency corporation has hired you as a spanning tree specialist. One of their customers has issues with a switched network that only has fiber connections. Every now and then there’s a problem with the fiber and as a result layer 2 loops occur. It will take two months for the fiber company to check all cables/connectors so you want a temporary solution…
Goal:
Configure SW1 so it is the root bridge for VLAN 1.
Configure your spanning-tree topology so the fa0/16 interface on SW3 becomes an alternate port.
Configure the fa0/16 interface on SW2 so it does not send or receive any BPDUs. This will cause a loop.
Configure all switches so this loop will be detected and SW3 will shut its fa0/16 interface.
It took me 1000s of hours reading books and doing labs, making mistakes over and over again until I mastered all the switch protocols for CCNP.
Would you like to be a master of switching too? In a short time without having to read 900 page books or google the answers to your questions and browsing through forums?
I collected all my knowledge and created a single ebook for you that has everything you need to know to become a master of switching.
