Ensure that Godzilla and Nessie can ping each other.
Ensure you can ping 3.3.3.3 from Godzilla, sourced from it’s Loopback0 interface.
We are going to configure an IPSEC connection between Router Godzilla and Nessie.
Create a ISAKMP policy:
Authentication: pre-shared-key
Encryption: AES 256
Hashing: SHA
DH: Group 5
Lifetime: 3600
Configure the pre-shared-key “VAULT” which you will use for the IPSEC connection.
Configure the IPSEC transform-set:
Cipher: AES 256
ESP (Encapsulating Security Protcol)
Hashing: SHA
Change the IPSEC security association lifetime to 1800 seconds.
You need to encrypt traffic from Router Godzilla’s Loopback0 interface destined to Nessie’s 
Loopback0 interface, create the correct access-list.
Ensure you have a correct access-list on both Routers.
Create the correct crypto-map to finish the IPSEC configuration.
Verify the IPSEC configuration, you can use the following show/debug commands:
show crypto ipsec transform-set
show crypto map
show crypto ipsec sa
debug crypto isakmp
Try a ping from Router Godzilla’s Loopback0 interface destined to Router Nessie’s 
Loopback0 interface, if your configuration is correct then traffic should be encrypted.</text></svg>
