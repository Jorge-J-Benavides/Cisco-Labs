Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.
You are the network engineer for a company in Florida that is specialized in campus LAN designs. One of your customers is having issues with their network and it seems their spanning-tree topology has been misconfigured. The network has a number of non-Cisco devices so you need to run an IEEE version of spanning-tree.
Goal:
Ensure all switches run PVST (default on most Cisco switches).
Create VLAN 10,20 and 30 on all switches.
Ensure SW1 is the root bridge for VLAN 10.
Ensure SW2 is the root bridge for VLAN 20.
Ensure SW3 is the root bridge for VLAN 30.
Ensure SW2 prefers the path through SW3 to reach the root bridge in VLAN 10. You are only allowed to change the cost.
Ensure SW3 prefers interface fa0/14 to reach the root bridge for VLAN 10. You are only allowed to change the port priority.
Ensure BPDUs are sent every second for VLAN 20.
Ensure the switches detect a problem in VLAN 30 after 6 seconds of not receiving BPDUs.
