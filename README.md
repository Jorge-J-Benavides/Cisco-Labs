# Cisco-Labs
This Repo is where I store the labs that I have configured in GNS3. The folders under this repo will contain all files necessary to run the labs in GNS3 except for the images needed to run the routers, switches, Ubuntu, etc.... The folders will also contain a read me explaining the lab, a picture of the topology, and other text files containing configs that I find useful and want to quickly reference.
