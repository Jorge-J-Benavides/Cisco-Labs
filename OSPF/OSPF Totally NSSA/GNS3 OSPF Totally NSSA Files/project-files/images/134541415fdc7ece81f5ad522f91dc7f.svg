Take a look at the routing table of Router Undertaker, you should see all 4 networks. Make sure you can ping them.
Change the area type of Area 1 so you don’t see the 4 networks anymore but only 1 default route.
Make sure you can still ping the 4 networks
Advertise last 4 loopback networks into OSPF Area 0 by using the network command.

Router Undertaker: create a loopback interface:
L0: 2.2.2.2 /24
Configure RIP version 2 and advertise the 2.2.2.0 network into RIP.

Make sure you still meet all the previous requirements.
