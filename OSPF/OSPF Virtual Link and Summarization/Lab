Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
The Company you are currently working for has recently bought a smaller organization and now needs to connect the 2 networks together. Company policy specifies that only OSPF can be used as a routing protocol and it’s physically impossible to connect the Louie router to the Huey router. Up to you to find a good solution…!
Goal:
All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
Configure OSPF on all routers, configure the areas as specified in the topology picture.
Area 2 has no direct connection to Area 0, solve this by using OSPF commands.
Ensure you have full reachability.
Create some extra loopbacks on router Louie and advertise them in area 2:
Loopback0: 172.16.0.1 /24
Loopback1: 172.16.1.1 /24
Loopback2: 172.16.2.1 /24
Loopback3: 172.16.3.1 /24
Make sure router Huey only sees 172.16.0.0/22 in it’s routing table, you are only allowed to make changes to router Dewey.
