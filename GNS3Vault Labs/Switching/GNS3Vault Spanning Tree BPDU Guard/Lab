Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.
You are working as the network engineer at a school located in Germany. The network has been having issues last month after students took a CCNA class. You want to make sure the access layer of the network is more secure. When students try to mess with spanning-tree it should block the interface they are connected to.
Goal:
Ensure all switches run PVST (default on most Cisco switches).
Ensure that whenever you receive a BPDU from router Neo it will block the interface.
After 400 seconds the interface should enable itself automatically again.
It took me 1000s of hours reading books and doing labs, making mistakes over and over again until I mastered all the switch protocols for CCNP.
Would you like to be a master of switching too? In a short time without having to read 900 page books or google the answers to your questions and browsing through forums?
I collected all my knowledge and created a single ebook for you that has everything you need to know to become a master of switching.
You will learn all the secrets about spanning-tree, BPDUs, BPDU guard and more.
