Scenario:
"I used cisco vm  cisco IOSvL2 images for this lab"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least a Cisco Catalyst 3550 switch for this lab.
The network agency corporation has security issues with their network. They are familiar with the configuration of access-lists but they have no idea how to filter traffic within a VLAN. You are familiar with Cisco catalyst switches so you decide to help them out to configure some VLAN access-lists (VACL).
Goal:
Configure all IP addresses as specified in the topology picture.
Configure SW1 so router DNS1 and DNS2 are unable to ping each other. Other traffic should be allowed.
The interfaces on SW1 have to be layer 2 switchports.
It took me 1000s of hours reading books and doing labs, making mistakes over and over again until I mastered all the switch protocols for CCNP.
Would you like to be a master of switching too? In a short time without having to read 900 page books or google the answers to your questions and browsing through forums?
I collected all my knowledge and created a single ebook for you that has everything you need to know to become a master of switching.
You will learn all the secrets about VLANs, VLAN access-lists, security, filtering and more.
Does this sound interesting to you? Take a look here and let me show you how to Master CCNP SWITCH
IOS:
Basic IOS for the switches should be sufficient. No special features needed.
