Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least a Cisco Catalyst 3550 switch for this lab.
One of your customers is being plagued by attacks on their switched infrastructure. You as a specialized switch specialist are looking for a method to counter DHCP spoofing attacks. Let’s see what you can do for them…
Goal:
Configure the IP addresses on router Attacker and DHCP as specified in the topology picture.
Configure DHCP server on router DHCP so it can serve the client an IP address.
Configure DHCP snooping globally on SW1.
Configure SW1 to use the correct trusted and untrusted interfaces.
Configure SW1 so the client is limited to 10 DHCP packets per second.
Configure router Attacker as a DHCP server to verify your DHCP snooping configuration.
