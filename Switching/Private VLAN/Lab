Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least a Cisco Catalyst 3560 switch for this lab.
Your are the senior network engineer of a small company specialized in switching solutions. The datacenter houses a couple of servers and you would like to increase security. You prefer to keep all servers within the same subnet and prevent the usage of access-lists. It sounds like Private VLANs could help you out…
Goal:
Configure all IP addresses as specified in the topology picture.
Configure VLAN 500 to be the primary VLAN.
Configure VLAN 501 as a secondary community VLAN.
Configure VLAN 502 as a secondary isolated VLAN.
Configure the correct mapping between the primary and secondary VLANs.
Configure DNS1 and DNS2 to be in the secondary community VLAN 501.
Configure WWW1 and WWW2 to be in the secondary isolated VLAN 502.
Configure fa0/24 on SwitchA as the promiscious port.
DNS1 and DNS2 should be able to communicate with each other and the Gateway.
WWW1 and WWW2 should only be able to communicate with the Gateway.
