Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least a Cisco Catalyst 3550 switch for this lab.
The network agency corporation has hired you as a spanning tree specialist. One of their customers has issues with a switched network that only has fiber connections. Every now and then there’s a problem with the fiber and as a result layer 2 loops occur. It will take two months for the fiber company to check all cables/connectors so you want a temporary solution…
Goal:
Configure all IP addresses as specified in the topology picture.
Configure SW1 so it builds a routing table.
Configure SW1 so router DNS1 and DNS2 are in VLAN 10.
Configure the fa0/3 interface on SW1 as a routed port.
Ensure all routers are able to communicate with each other.
