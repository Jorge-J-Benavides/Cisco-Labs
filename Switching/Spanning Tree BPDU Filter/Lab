Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.
You are working as the network engineer at a school located in Germany. The network has been having issues last month after students took a CCNA class. You want to make sure the access layer of the network is more secure. When students try to mess with spanning-tree it should block the interface they are connected to.
Goal:
Configure SW1 so it does not send any BPDUs towards router Neo. Any BPDU that you receive from router Neo should be ignored.
