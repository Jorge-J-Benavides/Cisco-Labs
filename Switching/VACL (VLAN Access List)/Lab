Scenario:
"I used cisco vm  cisco IOSvL2 images for this lab"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least a Cisco Catalyst 3550 switch for this lab.
The network agency corporation has security issues with their network. They are familiar with the configuration of access-lists but they have no idea how to filter traffic within a VLAN. You are familiar with Cisco catalyst switches so you decide to help them out to configure some VLAN access-lists (VACL).
Goal:
Configure all IP addresses as specified in the topology picture.
Configure SW1 so router DNS1 and DNS2 are unable to ping each other. Other traffic should be allowed.
The interfaces on SW1 have to be layer 2 switchports.
