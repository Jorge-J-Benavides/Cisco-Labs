Scenario:
"I Used gns3 vm and vm images"
For this lab you need REAL hardware. You can’t use switches in GNS3!
You need at least Catalyst 2950 switches for this lab.
Fiber ‘r’ us is specialized in fiber solutions for layer 2 switches. They are concerned that layer 2 loops might occur when the transmit or receive connectors of their fiber links get disconnected. You want to implement a feature that will prevent a loop in case this happens. You don’t want to use a spanning tree solution so there’s something else you’ll have to configure…
Goal:
Configure UDLD on interface fa0/16 of both switches, use aggressive mode.
Configure a MAC filter on SW2 that filters MAC address 0100.0ccc.cccc to simulate a link failure.
